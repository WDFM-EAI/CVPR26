2,https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=yVhkUZwAAAAJ&citpid=2,"Building an Autonomous Future",Tesla,Ashok Elluswamy,"Autonomous driving represents one of the most challenging applications of embodied AI, requiring real-time perception, prediction, and planning at scale. This talk will explore how foundation models and large-scale neural networks are being deployed in production autonomous systems. We will discuss the engineering challenges of deploying vision-language-action models in safety-critical applications, including model compression, latency optimization, and robustness guarantees. The talk will cover Tesla's approach to building end-to-end neural networks for autonomous driving, from multi-camera vision to trajectory planning, and the lessons learned from deploying these systems to millions of vehicles worldwide.","TBD",1,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eashokkumar/

This talk will present advances in end-to-end learning approaches for motion forecasting, where large foundation models learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor inputs. We will discuss how knowledge distillation techniques enable deploying these powerful models efficiently on edge devices while maintaining prediction accuracy. The presentation will cover Waymo's research on transformer-based architectures for multi-agent prediction, the challenges of training and deploying these models at scale, and recent advances in distilling complex forecasting models into production-ready systems.","TBD",1,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragomiranguelov/
